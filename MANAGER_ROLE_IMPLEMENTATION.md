# Manager Role Implementation - EventEase

## Overview
The Manager role has been successfully implemented in EventEase. Managers have all the privileges of admins except they cannot delete users or change user roles.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Files Created
- `app/Http/Middleware/ManagerMiddleware.php` - Middleware to allow both admin and manager access
- `app/Http/Controllers/Manager/DashboardController.php` - Manager dashboard controller
- `app/Http/Controllers/Manager/UserController.php` - Manager user management (read-only)
- `resources/views/manager/layout.blade.php` - Manager panel layout (purple theme)
- `resources/views/manager/dashboard.blade.php` - Manager dashboard view
- `resources/views/manager/users/index.blade.php` - Manager user management view
- `assign_manager_role.php` - Script to assign manager role to users
- `test_manager_setup.php` - Script to test and view user roles

### 2. Modified Files
- `bootstrap/app.php` - Added manager middleware alias
- `app/Models/User.php` - Added manager role helper methods
- `app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php` - Added manager role redirection
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/UserController.php` - Added manager restrictions
- `resources/views/admin/users/index.blade.php` - Added manager-specific UI restrictions
- `routes/web.php` - Added manager routes

### 3. Database Changes
No new migrations required. The existing `role` column in the `users` table already supports the 'manager' value.

## Features

### Manager Permissions ✅
- Full access to dashboard with statistics
- View and manage events (create, edit, delete)
- View and manage event requests (approve/reject)
- View and manage blogs (create, edit, delete)
- View and reply to messages
- View sales reports and statistics
- View and manage notices
- View payment received reports
- View all users (read-only)

### Manager Restrictions ❌
- Cannot delete any users
- Cannot change user roles
- Cannot access admin-only functions

## User Interface

### Design Differences
- **Admin Panel**: Cyan color scheme (#0891b2)
- **Manager Panel**: Purple color scheme (#8b5cf6)
- Clear visual distinction between roles
- Manager-specific branding and labels

### Navigation
- Manager panel accessible at `/manager`
- Auto-redirect from `/dashboard` based on role
- Separate navigation structure
- Purple-themed interface elements

## Access Control

### Middleware Implementation
```php
// ManagerMiddleware allows both admin and manager roles
public function handle($request, Closure $next)
{
    $userRole = strtolower((string)auth()->user()->role);
    
    if (!in_array($userRole, ['admin', 'manager'])) {
        abort(403, 'Manager or Admin access required');
    }
    
    return $next($request);
}
```

### Route Protection
```php
// Manager routes use 'manager' middleware
Route::prefix('manager')->middleware(['auth', 'verified', 'manager'])
```

### Controller Restrictions
```php
// Admin controllers check for manager role and restrict actions
if (auth()->user()->isManager()) {
    return back()->with('error', 'Managers cannot delete users.');
}
```

## User Role Helpers

### Added Methods to User Model
```php
public function isManager(): bool { return $this->role === 'manager'; }
public function isAdminOrManager(): bool { return in_array($this->role, ['admin', 'manager']); }
```

## Testing & Assignment

### Assign Manager Role
```bash
php assign_manager_role.php
```

### Check User Roles
```bash
php test_manager_setup.php
```

### Current Users (as of testing)
- Admin: 1 user
- Manager: 2 users  
- Organizer: 1 user
- User: 1 user

## URLs and Access Points

### Manager Panel URLs
- `/manager` - Manager dashboard
- `/manager/users` - User management (read-only)
- `/dashboard` - Auto-redirects to manager panel for manager users

### Shared Admin URLs (Manager Access)
- `/admin/events` - Event management
- `/admin/blogs` - Blog management
- `/admin/messages` - Message management
- `/admin/sales` - Sales reports
- `/admin/requests` - Event requests
- `/admin/notices` - Notice management
- `/admin/payments` - Payment received reports

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Managers inherit most admin permissions through middleware
- Explicit restrictions for user deletion and role changes
- Role-based UI hiding for restricted actions
- Server-side validation prevents unauthorized actions

### UI Restrictions
- Delete buttons hidden for managers in user management
- Role change dropdowns disabled for managers
- Clear visual indicators of restricted actions
- Helpful error messages for unauthorized attempts

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- Manager-specific statistics and reports
- Audit log for manager actions
- Custom permission granularity
- Manager role assignment notifications
- Bulk user management tools (view-only)

### Scalability
- Easy to extend with additional manager-specific features
- Clean separation between admin and manager functionality
- Modular controller structure allows for easy customization

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The Manager role implementation is fully functional and ready for production use. Managers can access all admin features except user deletion and role management, providing a secure and controlled administrative experience.
