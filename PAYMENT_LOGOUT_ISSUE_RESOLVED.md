## 🛠️ **Implementation Details**

### **1. New Payment Status Pages**

#### **Payment Cancelled Page** - `/payment/cancelled`
- Shows when user clicks "YES, CANCEL" in SSLCommerz
- Displays event details (name, quantity, amount)
- Confirms no money was charged
- Provides "Buy Tickets" and "Browse Events" buttons
- **Accessible without login** (public route)

#### **Payment Failed Page** - `/payment/failed`  
- Shows when payment fails (insufficient funds, card issues, etc.)

- Provides troubleshooting tips
- Offers "Try Again" and "Browse Events" options  
- **Accessible without login** (public route)

### **2. Updated Controller Logic**

#### **`paymentCancel()` Method:**
```php
// ✅ Preserves user authentication
// ✅ Clears only payment session data
// ✅ Stores cancellation info for display
// ✅ Redirects to public cancellation page
```

#### **`paymentFail()` Method:**
```php
// ✅ Preserves user authentication  
// ✅ Clears only payment session data
// ✅ Stores failure info for display
// ✅ Redirects to public failure page
```

### **3. Enhanced Session Management**
- **Preserves authentication session** - User stays logged in
- **Clears payment data only** - Removes transaction/checkout data
- **Stores status information** - For display on status pages
- **Enhanced logging** - For debugging any issues
