2. Register for a sandbox account
3. After approval, you'll receive:

#### For Production:
1. Visit [SSLCommerz](https://www.sslcommerz.com/)
2. Contact their sales team
3. Complete business verification
4. Receive live credentials

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with actual SSLCommerz credentials:

```env
# SSLCommerz Configuration
SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_ID=your_actual_store_id
SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_PASSWORD=your_actual_store_password
SSLCOMMERZ_API_URL=https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com/gwprocess/v4/api.php
SSLCOMMERZ_VALIDATION_URL=https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com/validator/api/validationserverAPI.php
SSLCOMMERZ_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
SSLCOMMERZ_SUCCESS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/payment/success
SSLCOMMERZ_FAIL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/payment/fail
SSLCOMMERZ_CANCEL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/payment/cancel
SSLCOMMERZ_IPN_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/payment/ipn
```

**Important:** Replace `your_actual_store_id` and `your_actual_store_password` with your real credentials!

### Step 3: Clear Configuration Cache

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
```

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## üöÄ How It Works

### Payment Flow:

1. **User selects "Pay Now (SSLCommerz)"** on checkout page
2. **Form submits to SSLCommerzController** 
3. **Transaction data stored in session**
4. **Payment request sent to SSLCommerz API**
5. **User redirected to SSLCommerz payment page**
6. **User completes payment**
7. **SSLCommerz redirects back to success/fail URL**
8. **Payment validated with SSLCommerz**
9. **Ticket created with "paid" status**
10. **User sees success page with ticket details**

### Backend Components:

#### SSLCommerzService
- Handles API communication with SSLCommerz
- Manages payment initiation and validation
- Provides error handling and logging

#### SSLCommerzController
- Manages the complete payment flow

New fields added to `tickets` table:

- `sslcommerz_bank_tran_id` - Bank transaction ID  
- `sslcommerz_card_type` - Card type used
- `payment_method` - Payment method identifier
- `payment_verified_at` - Payment verification timestamp
