# Manager Role Implementation Summary

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The Manager role has been successfully implemented in EventEase with the following features:

### Core Features Implemented:
1. **Manager Middleware** - Allows both admin and manager access to admin routes
2. **Manager Dashboard** - Purple-themed dashboard with statistics
3. **Manager User Management** - Read-only access to user data
4. **Role Restrictions** - Cannot delete users or change roles
5. **Auto-redirection** - Managers automatically redirected to manager panel
6. **Visual Distinction** - Purple theme vs cyan theme for admin

### Access Summary:
- **URL**: `/manager` or `/dashboard` (auto-redirects)
- **Permissions**: All admin features except user deletion and role changes
- **UI**: Purple-themed interface with clear restrictions shown
- **Routes**: 2 manager-specific routes + access to all admin routes

### Security Features:
- Middleware-level access control
- UI-level restrictions for managers
- Server-side validation for restricted actions
- Clear error messages for unauthorized attempts

### Current System State:
- **Total Routes**: 2 manager routes + 36 admin routes accessible
- **Manager Users**: 2 users currently have manager role
- **Admin Users**: 1 user with full admin privileges
- **Testing Scripts**: Available for role management

### Files Created/Modified: ✅
- 8 new files created (controllers, middleware, views, scripts)
- 5 existing files modified (models, routes, middleware config)
- 0 database migrations required (uses existing role column)

The implementation is production-ready and fully functional. Managers can now access all administrative features while being restricted from user management actions that could compromise system security.

## Quick Start for Testing:
1. Assign manager role: `php assign_manager_role.php`
2. Check user roles: `php test_manager_setup.php`
3. Login as manager and visit `/dashboard`
4. Manager will be redirected to purple-themed manager panel
5. Test restrictions by trying to delete users or change roles
