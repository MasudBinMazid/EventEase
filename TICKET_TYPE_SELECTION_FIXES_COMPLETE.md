# Ticket Type Selection Issues - FIXED

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **PRIMARY ISSUE: Ticket Generation Failure for Non-First Ticket Types**

**Problem**: When users selected ticket types other than the first one, tickets were not generating after SSLCommerz payment.

**Root Cause**: The SSLCommerzController was passing the ticket type ID (integer) to the `createTicketAndQr` method, but the method expected a TicketType model object.

**Fix Applied**:
```php
// Before (BROKEN):
$ticketTypeId = isset($tempTransaction->data['ticket_type_id']) ? $tempTransaction->data['ticket_type_id'] : null;
$ticket = app(\App\Http\Controllers\TicketController::class)
    ->createTicketAndQr($tempTransaction->event, $tempTransaction->quantity, 'pay_now', 'paid', $ticketTypeId);

// After (FIXED):
$ticketTypeId = isset($tempTransaction->data['ticket_type_id']) ? $tempTransaction->data['ticket_type_id'] : null;
$ticketType = null;
if ($ticketTypeId) {
    $ticketType = \App\Models\TicketType::find($ticketTypeId);
}
$ticket = app(\App\Http\Controllers\TicketController::class)
    ->createTicketAndQr($tempTransaction->event, $tempTransaction->quantity, 'pay_now', 'paid', $ticketType);
```

### 2. **ENHANCEMENT: Ticket Type Quantity Tracking**

**Issue**: Ticket type quantities were not being updated when tickets were sold.

**Fix Applied**: Enhanced the `createTicketAndQr` method to properly track sold quantities:
```php
// Update ticket type quantity sold if applicable
if ($ticketType) {
    $ticketType->increment('quantity_sold', $qty);
    
    // Update ticket type status if sold out
    if ($ticketType->quantity_sold >= $ticketType->quantity_available) {
        $ticketType->update(['status' => 'sold_out']);
    }
}
```

### 3. **MISSING FEATURE: Admin Event Edit with Ticket Types**

**Problem**: The admin event edit form didn't have ticket type management functionality like the create form.

**Fix Applied**: 
- **Added complete ticket type section to edit form** with existing ticket type population
- **Enhanced EventAdminController update method** to handle ticket type CRUD operations
- **Added proper validation** for ticket type updates
