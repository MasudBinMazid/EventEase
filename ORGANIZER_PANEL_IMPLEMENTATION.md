# Organizer Panel Feature Implementation

## Overview
The organizer panel has been successfully implemented for EventEase. This feature allows users with the 'organizer' role to manage their own events exclusively.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Role System Enhancement
- Added 'organizer' role to the User model
- Enhanced User model with `isOrganizer()` method
- Updated User model to include `events()` relationship

### 2. Middleware
- Created `OrganizerMiddleware` to restrict access to organizer-only routes
- Registered middleware in `bootstrap/app.php`

### 3. Controllers
- Created `OrganizerController` with methods:
  - `index()` - Dashboard with event statistics
  - `show()` - View individual event details (only own events)
  - `tickets()` - View tickets for their events

### 4. Views
- Organizer layout with clean, professional design
- Dashboard view with statistics and event management
- Event details view with comprehensive information
- Tickets view with sales analytics

### 5. Routes
- Protected organizer routes under `/organizer` prefix
- Role-based dashboard redirection

### 6. Security Features
- Organizers can only access events they created (`created_by` field)
- Cannot edit, update, or delete events (read-only access)
- Cannot access other organizers' events
- Proper middleware protection

## Security Restrictions Implemented
- ✅ Organizers can only view events they created
- ✅ Cannot modify or delete events
- ✅ Cannot access admin functions
- ✅ Cannot see other organizers' data
- ✅ Middleware protection on all routes

## How to Assign Organizer Role

### Method 1: Direct Database Update (For Testing)
```sql
UPDATE users SET role = 'organizer' WHERE email = 'organizer@example.com';
```

### Method 2: Laravel Tinker
```php
php artisan tinker
$user = App\Models\User::where('email', 'organizer@example.com')->first();
$user->role = 'organizer';
$user->save();
```

### Method 3: Via Admin Panel (Future Enhancement)
The admin panel can be extended to allow admins to assign organizer roles to users.

## Access URLs
- Organizer Dashboard: `/organizer`
- Event Details: `/organizer/events/{event}`
- Event Tickets: `/organizer/events/{event}/tickets`

## Navigation Updates
- Dashboard link now shows appropriate text based on user role:
  - Admin: "Admin Panel"
  - Organizer: "Organizer Panel" 
  - Regular User: "Dashboard"

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Event editing capabilities for organizers
2. Event analytics and reporting
3. Communication with ticket buyers
4. Event promotion tools
5. Revenue tracking and payouts

## Testing Steps
1. Create/assign organizer role to a user
2. Create events using that user's account
3. Login and visit `/organizer` to see the panel
4. Verify security by trying to access other users' events
5. Test ticket sales and view analytics

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with the existing system while adding comprehensive organizer functionality.
