# Database Error Fix - Payment Cancellation Issue RESOLVED

## 🚨 **Error Identified:**
```
SQLSTATE[01000]: Warning: 1265 Data truncated for column 'status' at row 1
SQL: update `temp_transactions` set `status` = cancelled
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The `temp_transactions` table had an ENUM column for `status` with values:
- `'pending'`, `'processing'`, `'completed'`, `'failed'`

But our code was trying to insert `'cancelled'` which was **not included** in the ENUM definition.

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **Immediate Fix (Applied):**
Changed the controller to use `'failed'` status instead of `'cancelled'` and store cancellation details in the data field:

```php
// Before (Causing Error):
'status' => 'cancelled'

// After (Fixed):
'status' => 'failed'
'data' => [
    'cancelled_at' => now()->toISOString(),
    'cancellation_reason' => 'Cancelled by user'
]
```

### **Database Fix (Optional but Recommended):**
To properly support cancelled status, run this SQL in your database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE temp_transactions MODIFY COLUMN status ENUM('pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled') DEFAULT 'pending';
```
