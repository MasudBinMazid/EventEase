# Purchase History Feature Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a Purchase History feature that separates tickets marked as "entered" from valid tickets in the user dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Changes âœ…
- **Modified Dashboard**: Now shows only valid tickets (not entered) under "Valid Tickets ðŸŽ«"
- **Added History Link**: Added "History" button in the tickets panel header
- **Entry Status Indicator**: Added "Ready for Entry" status for paid tickets
- **Updated Empty State**: Clarified that entered tickets are moved to Purchase History

### 2. New Purchase History Page âœ…
- **New Route**: `/purchase-history` with authentication middleware
- **Dedicated View**: `resources/views/auth/purchase-history.blade.php`
- **Entered Tickets Display**: Shows only tickets with `entry_status = 'entered'`
- **Entry Details**: Shows when ticket was marked as entered and by whom
- **Navigation**: Back link to dashboard and consistent styling

### 3. Controller Updates âœ…
- **ProfileController**: Modified `dashboard()` method to filter valid tickets only
- **New Method**: Added `purchaseHistory()` method to fetch entered tickets
- **Proper Relationships**: Uses `entryMarker` relationship to show who marked the ticket

### 4. Database Query Logic âœ…
- **Valid Tickets**: `entry_status = 'not_entered'` OR `entry_status IS NULL`
- **Entered Tickets**: `entry_status = 'entered'`
- **Ordered by**: Latest entered tickets first (`entry_marked_at`)

## Files Modified
```
app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php
routes/web.php
resources/views/auth/dashboard.blade.php
resources/views/auth/purchase-history.blade.php (new)
```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Regular Dashboard
- Shows only valid tickets that haven't been used for entry
- Clear "Ready for Entry" status for paid tickets
- "History" button to access purchase history

### 2. Purchase History Page
- Lists all tickets that have been marked as entered
- Shows entry timestamp and who marked it
- Maintains PDF download and view functionality
- Back navigation to dashboard

### 3. Ticket Entry Process
- When a ticket is marked as "entered" (via QR verification system)
- It automatically moves from dashboard to purchase history
- User gets a clear separation between usable and used tickets

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Valid vs. used tickets are clearly separated
2. **Better UX**: Users can easily find tickets they can still use
3. **History Tracking**: Complete record of attended events
4. **Entry Verification**: Shows who marked tickets as entered and when
5. **Consistent Design**: Matches existing UI patterns and styling

## Testing
1. **Server Running**: `http://127.0.0.1:8001`
2. **Routes Available**:
   - `/dashboard` - Shows valid tickets
   - `/purchase-history` - Shows entered tickets
3. **Authentication**: Both routes require authenticated users

## Integration with Existing System
- Works seamlessly with existing ticket entry status feature
- Maintains all existing functionality (view, download PDF)
- No breaking changes to existing data or workflows
- Leverages existing `entry_status` field in tickets table

The feature is now ready for use and will automatically organize tickets based on their entry status!
