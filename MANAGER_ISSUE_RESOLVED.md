# Manager Role Implementation - ISSUE RESOLVED

## ✅ Issue Fixed: EventRequest Model Not Found

### Problem
The Manager Dashboard Controller was trying to use a non-existent `App\Models\EventRequest` model, causing an "Internal Server Error".

### Root Cause
Event requests in EventEase are actually stored as `Event` models with `status = 'pending'`, not as a separate `EventRequest` model.

### Solution Applied
Updated `app/Http/Controllers/Manager/DashboardController.php`:

**Before (Broken):**
```php
use App\Models\EventRequest;

'pending_requests' => EventRequest::where('status', 'pending')->count(),

$recent_requests = EventRequest::with('user')->latest()->take(5)->get();
```

**After (Fixed):**
```php
// Removed EventRequest import

'pending_requests' => Event::where('status', 'pending')->count(),

$recent_requests = Event::with('creator')
    ->where('status', 'pending')
    ->latest()
    ->take(5)
    ->get();
```

### Additional Fixes
- Updated manager dashboard view to use `$request->creator->name` instead of `$request->user->name`
- Confirmed Event model has proper `creator()` relationship to User model
- Verified all other manager functionality remains intact

## ✅ Current Status: FULLY WORKING

### Manager Role Features ✅
- **Dashboard**: Purple-themed with real statistics
- **User Management**: Read-only access, cannot delete users or change roles
- **Event Management**: Full access via shared admin routes
- **Blog Management**: Full access via shared admin routes  
- **Message Management**: Full access via shared admin routes
- **Sales Reports**: Full access via shared admin routes
- **Event Requests**: Full access to approve/reject pending events

### Access URLs ✅
- `http://127.0.0.1:8001/manager` - Manager dashboard
- `http://127.0.0.1:8001/manager/users` - User management (read-only)
- `http://127.0.0.1:8001/dashboard` - Auto-redirects to manager panel for manager users
- All admin routes (`/admin/*`) accessible to managers via middleware

### Security Restrictions ✅
- ❌ Cannot delete users (UI hidden + server-side validation)
- ❌ Cannot change user roles (UI hidden + server-side validation)
- ✅ All other admin functions accessible
- ✅ Clear visual indicators of restrictions in UI

### Testing Status ✅
- [x] Manager middleware allows manager access
- [x] Manager dashboard loads without errors
- [x] Statistics display correctly
- [x] Recent activities populate properly
- [x] Manager-specific restrictions work
- [x] Auto-redirect functionality works
- [x] Purple-themed UI distinguishes from admin panel

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified to Fix Issue:
