# Ticket Entry Status Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature allows event organizers to mark tickets as "entered" when verifying them at the event entrance. Once a ticket is marked as entered, subsequent verification attempts will show that the user has already entered the event.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `entry_status` ENUM field with values: `'not_entered'`, `'entered'` (default: `'not_entered'`)
- Added `entry_marked_at` TIMESTAMP field to track when the ticket was marked as entered
- Added `entry_marked_by` foreign key to track which user marked the ticket as entered

### 2. Backend Changes

#### TicketController Updates
- **Enhanced `verify()` method**: Now returns entry status information along with ticket details
- **New `markAsEntered()` method**: Marks a ticket as entered and records timestamp and user
- **New helper `getTicketStatusMessage()`**: Returns appropriate status messages based on entry status

#### Route Changes
- Added new POST route: `/verify/{ticketCode}/enter` for marking tickets as entered

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### Verification Page Updates
- **Enhanced UI**: Shows entry status in ticket verification results
- **Visual Indicators**: Different colors and icons for different entry statuses
  - ‚úÖ Green: Valid ticket, not entered (ready for entry)
  - üé´ Orange: Already entered
  - ‚ùå Red: Invalid ticket
- **Mark as Entered Button**: Appears only for valid, not-entered tickets
- **Success Notifications**: Shows confirmation when ticket is successfully marked as entered
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically refreshes verification data after marking as entered

## Entry Status Flow

### 1. Initial State
- All new tickets have `entry_status = 'not_entered'`
- `entry_marked_at` and `entry_marked_by` are NULL

### 2. First Verification
- Shows "Valid ticket - ready for entry"
- Displays "Mark as Entered" button for paid, valid tickets

### 3. Marking as Entered
- Updates `entry_status` to `'entered'`
- Records current timestamp in `entry_marked_at`
- Records user ID in `entry_marked_by` (if authenticated)
- Shows success message and updates display

### 4. Subsequent Verifications
- Shows "User already entered the event" message
- Displays entry timestamp and who marked it
- No "Mark as Entered" button shown

## API Responses

### Verification API (`GET /verify/{ticketCode}`)
```json
{
    "valid": true,
    "message": "Valid ticket - ready for entry", // or "User already entered the event"
    "status": "paid",
    "entry_status": "not_entered", // or "entered"
    "data": {
        "ticket_code": "TKT-ABCD1234",
        "event_title": "Sample Event",
        "holder_name": "John Doe",
        // ... other ticket details
        "entry_status": "not_entered",
        "entry_marked_at": "Sep 04, 2025 10:30 AM", // if entered
        "entry_marked_by": "Admin User" // if entered
    }
}
```

### Mark as Entered API (`POST /verify/{ticketCode}/enter`)
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Ticket successfully marked as entered",
    "data": {
        "ticket_code": "TKT-ABCD1234",
        "holder_name": "John Doe",
        "event_title": "Sample Event",
        "entry_marked_at": "Sep 04, 2025 10:30 AM",
        "quantity": 1
    }
}
```

## Security & Validation

### Entry Validation
- Only paid tickets can be marked as entered
- Cannot mark already entered tickets again
- Proper error messages for invalid attempts

### CSRF Protection
- All POST requests require valid CSRF tokens
- Tokens are automatically handled in the frontend

### Authentication
- Entry marking works for both authenticated and anonymous users
- If authenticated, records which user marked the entry
- If anonymous, `entry_marked_by` remains NULL

## Usage Instructions

### For Event Organizers
1. Open the verification page: `/verify`
2. Enter ticket code manually or scan QR code
3. For valid, unpaid tickets: Shows "Ticket payment not confirmed"
4. For valid, paid, not-entered tickets: Shows "Valid ticket - ready for entry" with "Mark as Entered" button
5. For already entered tickets: Shows "User already entered the event" with entry details
6. Click "Mark as Entered" to allow entry and record attendance

### Testing
- Test page available at: `/test-workflow` (remove in production)
- Shows available tickets and allows testing both verification and entry marking
- Includes sample tickets from the database
